# Musical_Vocabulary

This project was meant to let me explore dart and flutter while also learning a bit of music theory.

## The idea

I'm a guitarist but i don't know much about music theory. So the idea is to have a simple app that i can interrogate when i want to know the notes in a scale or in a chord.
So, the main page lets me decide if i want to lookup scales or chords, and the second page lets me pick the root note of the scale or chord. The result is a page displaying a set of scales or chords that have the choosen note as root.
